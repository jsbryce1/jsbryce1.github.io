            <p> My name is Jared Bryce, I was born in chandler Arizona on          March 17th, 1991. I Moved to Utah at the age of 5 and
                did all of my elementary, middle school and High School education here. I wen't to Jordan High School and
                graduated in 2009. I Worked in a music store repairing and selling guitars, banjos, violins, ukulele's and
                other stringed instruments for four years.

            <p>
                I took care of disabled adults in a residential setting for the next four years. I managed the prep at Este in sugarhouse
                and worked at Gamestop for the last year until starting the University of Utah Coding Bootcamp. In my free
                time I enjoy playing videogames, guitar (or any string instrument) going to concerts, hanging out with friends,
                reading articles on the internet and researching many topics from tech to cars to history. I have a huge
                passion for the tech industry and have studied many aspects of it form networking and routers to building
                computers and gadgets! I have been really enjoying about learning web development!
